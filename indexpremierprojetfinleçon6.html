        The preseason kicked off with a series of live-streamed exhibition matches featuring<br> 
        11 teams (Philidelphia fusion did not play in the preseason) at the Blizzard Arena in <br>
        Los Angeles on December 6th - 9th.<br>
    <Srtrong>Regular Season</Srtrong> - January 10th - June 16th, 2018<br>
        <em>Matches in the Atlantic and Pacific Divisions played out live from the Blizzard Arena<br>
         each Wednesday through Saturday</em>. While the season was divided into four stages, wins and<br>
          losses in every stage counted towards the teams' full-season records and seeding for the<br>
           postseason. On the last Sunday of each stage, the top teams competed for hefty bonuses and<br>
            the title of stage winner.<br>
        * Stage 1 - January 10th - February 10th, 2018 [1]<br>
        * Stage 2 - February 21st - March 24th, 2018<br>

    <strong>Postseason (Playoffs)</strong> - June 17th - July 28th, 2018<br>
        <em>After Stage 4 finished, the top finishers in each division along with the next four <br>
        teams in rankings regardless of division qualified for playoffs</em>, which took place during<br>
         July 11th – 21th. The top two finishers received a first-round bye. The Grand Final on<br>
          July 27th – 28th determined the first Overwatch League champion team, claiming glory, the<br>
           Overwatch League trophy, and a USD $1 million bonus.<br>
    <Strong>All-Star</Strong> - August 25th - August 26th, 2018<br>
